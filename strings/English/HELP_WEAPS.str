LANG_ENGLISH        "A powerful, graceful weapon used by the Jedi and Sith, described by Obi-Wan Kenobi as an 'elegant weapon from a more civilized age, not as clumsy or random as a blaster.' Lightsabers are difficult weapons to wield indeed, requiring much skill and practice to be used effectively. To beings familiar with swords and Vibroblades, the small weight of the saber is concentrated entirely in the hilt, and a strong gyroscopic effect is generated by the powerful weightless plasma blade. In MovieBattles 2, humanoid armor provides a small amount of resistance against lightsaber damage (20%, meaning that 100 armor will absorb 120 saber damage).\n\nSaber Styles :\n\nBlue --\nA fast stance which does not slow down movement while swinging, with strong defense but weaker offense in Saber versus Saber. Deals 120 base damage per slash and slashes are very fast. Especially effective against gunner classes with low HP such as the Soldier, and the Commander without armor level 3.\n\nSpecial Abilities: Force Focusing enemies who aren't using Blue requires less time, and non-Blue users require more time to Force Focus a Blue user. Incoming blaster fire and projectiles can also be blocked while using Slap / Saber Melee (Class Special 2).\n\n\nYellow --\nDeals 240 base damage per slash. This style is the most basic, and at the same time the most versatile stance in the game.\n\nSpecial Abilities: None.\n\n\nRed --\nThis stance has long windups for swings and weaker defense but slashes deal heavy HP damage (600), BP drain, and it has a very strong special attack (see Special Attacks page). Effective at close range in Saber versus Saber, and against slow gunner classes with high HP (Wookiee, SBD, Droideka).\n\nSpecial Abilities: Perfect Blocks will cause the attacker to lose BP. The third slash of a combo will also stagger the opponent. The Jedi also receives increased Damage Reduction at all times regardless of whether they are attacking or blocking (0.65x damage), against most harmful sources (though not lightsaber damage).\n\n\nCyan style (or Tavion style) --\n This fast stance benefits from the fastest starting swings, and, like Blue style, does not slow down movement while swinging. Slightly more offensive than Blue style, deals 120 HP damage per hit. It has roughly the same tactical patterns as Blue Style.\n\nSpecial Abilities: It still drains BP on parries (when 2 saber swings cancel-out) with the first swing in one of its combo. FP regenerates while doing wall-acrobatics or backflips, and those moves have no FP cost.\n\n\nPurple (or Desann style) --\n A strong stance, faster but less powerful than Red style, deals 400 HP damage per hit. Effective strategies to use this style are similar to Red style's.\n\nSpecial Abilities: Is able to gain 1 ACC per enemy saber combo by perfect blocking a swing from the combo. Benefits from a reduction of all FP drains for deflecting projectiles by a 0.8x multiplier.\n\n\nDuals (Green / Two Lightsabers) --\nThis stance has extremely fast attacks, and as such is able to dish furious combinations quickly draining BP from an opponent, although it has an average defense. Deals 260 HP damage per hit.\n\nSpecial Abilities: Hitting with a Saber Melee / Slap (Class Special 2) will drain 16 BP from the opponent. FP costs for all force power usage are reduced by a 0.75x multiplier.\n\n\nStaff (White / Double-Bladed Lightsaber) --\nThe Staff style has a very strong base defense and an attack power similar to that of Yellow style. Deals 260 HP damage per hit.\n\nSpecial Abilities: MBlocking a swingblock will stagger the attacker, as opposed to no effect with other styles; additionally, MBlocking no longer requires camera aim, only movement + attack tapping. Has an especially wide arc for blocking saber slashes and blaster fire (1.5x size). FP regeneration increased by a 1.3x multiplier outside of combat (3 seconds after last combat action).\n\n\n\nNote: For more detailed information on Jedi abilities such as the Saber Defense ability, see the Jedi / Sith class description in the class guide. For info on dueling and detailed description of the styles' abilities, see the Strategy section (Saber versus Saber and Saber versus Gun)."

LANG_ENGLISH        "Special Attacks - These are powerful attacks that drain FP and BP, and usually leave the player open for a short time after use, although FP drains for deflecting blaster fire are halved while using special attacks. It is possible to defend against them with a lightsaber, by parrying them (cancelling them out with your own normal swing or special attack). Some have different functionality than Base JA.\n\nLunge (Blue / Fast style) - Crouch + Forward + Attack \n- A solid hit will deal heavy knockback to an opponent.\n\nOverhead Slash / YDFA (Yellow / Medium) - Jump + Forward + Attack\n- An attack that staggers the opponent and if aimed carefully can reach behind the opponent's defenses for a 1-hit KO, and otherwise deals good BP drain. Cyan style has a similar special move, but performs a mid-air stab instead of a slash and deals more BP damage instead of staggering. \n\nRDFA (Red / Strong Style) - Jump + Forward + Attack\n- A powerful slash that does massive BP drain and can knockdown opponents.\n\nButterfly (Staff & Duals) - Jump + Direction + Attack\n- A powerful aerial flurry of attacks that can deal heavy BP drain. Duals can only do a forward butterfly, while Staff can do forwards and sideways butterfly attacks.\n\nTwirl (Staff & Duals) - Crouch + Forward + Attack\n- A rapid flurry of attacks that can quickly drain the BP of an opponent at point blank range.\n\nDouble Stabs (Duals) - Use + Backwards/Left/Right + Attack\n- Stabs with long range that deal BP drain and knockback. Press backwards to do stabs that go infront of and behind you, or press Left or Right to do stabs out to either side.\n\nRoll Stab (All Saber Styles) - Forward Roll + Attack -\nA powerful stab that deals heavy BP drain with a body hit. It can be interrupted however if you are perfect-blocked before the attack is finished.\n\nBackslash (All Saber Styles) - Use + Backward + Attack\n- Must be used when the opponent is behind you. Deals knockback and moderate BP drain.\n\nCartwheel (All Styles except Staff) - Jump + Left/Right + Attack\n- Doing a cartwheel and then slashing out of the landing allows you to do a Half-Swing (see Advanced Dueling under the Strategy section). Also useful for dodging slashes and avoiding BP drain. \n\nPurple Stab (Desann/Purple style) - Crouch + Forward + Attack\n- An instantaneous stab, very useful for both defense and offense ; deals significant knockback."

LANG_ENGLISH        "Melee fighting is generally the last solution when losing all ammo or BP, however it can be powerful in the right hands. It may also be used to make traps (unexpected knockdowns) or harm lightsaber users (though it is rather dangerous). For Wookiees melee is a very powerful weapon, and instead of kicks they use a claw attack which can be used while moving. SBD and Droideka cannot use melee, however the SBD can knock enemies down with a powerful slap. Soldiers must buy the Close Combat Training ability to use melee effectively. \n\nJedi/Sith generally have the advantage in melee as they can leap up quickly from knockdown, even doing jump kicks, whereas most armored gunner classes get up more slowly. Most melee attacks are armor-ignoring as well, except for melee katas. However the only thing able to defeat a Wookiee in Melee is likely another Wookiee.\n\nBlocking using the reload key allows punches, kicks, and some special attacks (but not katas) to be blocked given enough stamina (represented by a yellow bar where ammo would normally be) is available. Blocking a punch as it hits you triggers a short counter-attack on the attacker dealing roughly 10-20 damage.\n\n\nMoves :\nPunch (Primary Fire) -\nDamage = 8 (right hand), 7 (left hand)\n\nKick (Secondary Fire) - \nDamage = 5\n\nKata (Primary + Secondary Fire) -\n Grabbing an opponent with this move allows you to carry out long, heavy damage-dealing attack which can be canceled by switching weapons. Holding a certain direction while grabbing allows you to perform different katas, a choke and forward throw (no direction), a triple punch combo (Forward), and a front-and-back double flip slam. Each kata has a slightly different speed and total damage, but each kata does at least 50 damage.\nIf you kata while someone is directly behind you, you will flip them over your back to your front for 20 damage.\n\nSpecial Attacks:\nUppercut - (Forward + Use + Primary Fire); crushes the guard of the opponent in one blow, but has short range\nDamage = 12\n\nSweep Kick - (Crouch + Alt. Attack); knocks over anyone but crouched enemies who are guarding/blocking\nDamage = 2, 20 if opponent is already knocked over\n\nJump Kick - (Forward + Use + Alt.

Use wisely!"

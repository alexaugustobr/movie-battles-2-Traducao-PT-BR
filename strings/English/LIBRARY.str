LANG_ENGLISH        "Open Mode is our mod's standard mode. It pits two teams against each other\nin timed five minute rounds.  The offensive team must complete their primary objectives to win before time runs out while the defending team tries to stop them by either killing them all or by holding them until the timer runs out. \n\nAll game modes utilize a Last Man Standing mechanic. This means that, if a\n player is killed during a round, he will remain dead for the rest of the duration\n of the round. However, some classes can purchase an ability which grants\n them more lives to play in each round.\n\nEach team is made up of seven different classes based on movie character\n archetypes, each with their own specialty.  Every class can contribute with\n it's own unique skill set which can be upgraded by players.\n\nOpen Mode prioritizes balanced battles between the forces of good and the forces of evil. Players start with a given number of points that they can use\n to purchase or upgrade weapons, abilities, equipment or powers for their\n selected class. The different variety of classes, each with it's own set of\n movie characters, gives players freedom on what roles they want to play\n across the wide range of movie-based scenarios recreated on the mod.\n\nWith Open Mode, players can play as their favourite characters in unusual situations and create interesting What If? scenarios, such as having Vader\n and his Stormtroopers fighting against the Jedi on Naboo or Darth Maul\n teaming up with Jango Fett and trying to capture the Rebel intruders on the\n Death Star."

Each character comes with predefined equipment and abilities that are stated on it's description.\n\nFull Authentic Mode aims to recreate each battle just like it originally took\n place in the Saga timeline. Any number of players can join a Full Authentic\n game, but only the corresponding number of players to avaiable characters\n on that specific battle can play at any given time. Remaining players can\nplay as a generic weak character (normally a soldier if avaiable) or they will\n remain as observers until the round ends. When one character is killed, his\n player is put at the end of the observer queue and the next person in line for\n that specific character will play as him on the next round.\n\nIn Full Authentic Mode, players can play as their favourite characters in the famous Star Wars battle scenarios, such as playing as Darth Vader and his Stormtroopers while they board the Rebel Tantive IV ship or playing as Obi-\n-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Padmé Amidala against Darth Maul and\n Trade Federation Battle and Destroyer droids on Naboo."

Any number of players\n can join a duel map, but only the corresponding number of characters to that duel can play at any given time. Remaining players will remain in Spectator\n until a match is complete. When one character is eliminated, his player is put\n at the end of the observer queue and the next person in line for that specific\n character will play as him on the next round.\n\nThe winner of the duel continues to play against new opponents until he or\n she is eliminated or his win streak limit of three times is reached. \n\n Duels usually pit 1 vs 1 confrontations, like Vader vs Luke in the Carbonite\n Chamber, Palpatine vs Yoda in the Senate Room or Anakin vs Obi-Wan on Mustafar. There are also a few instances of 2 vs 1 duels, like Dooku vs Obi-\n -Wan and Anakin aboard the Invisible Hand or Darth Maul vs Qui-Gon Jinn\n and Obi-Wan on Naboo. There's even a 4 vs 1 battle where Mace Windu and\n his fellow Jedi Masters fight Palpatine in his office on Coruscant.\n Each scenario will have as many playable characters as the ones needed to\n reenact the duel accurately to the Saga's history."

In order to be effective,\n players need to understand the basic key aspects of these classes. First \nand foremost, blocking enemy attacks with a lightsaber is now done through\n the use of a defense mode which is triggered manually. While defending,\n both the Jedi or Sith's mobility will be reduced, forcing them to walk.\n\nAnother important aspect is the addition of Blocking Points (BP). In saber\n duels, BP is a representation of both the warrior's stamina and concentration\n during the battle. Attacking and blocking drain BP to a degree, depending on\n a number of factors. BP will slowly regenerate when the player holds the\n defense mode. If a player's BP is completely drained, he will no longer be able\n to block incoming enemy saber attacks.\n\nAs a Jedi or a Sith you have access to various Force Powers, both active\n and passive. Using Force Powers or defending yourself against blaster fire\n will drain your Force Points (FP). If you have no more FP, you won't be able to block incoming enemy fire or to use Force Powers. However, your FP will\nautomatically regenerate over time.\n For more specific information on specific Jedi or Sith abilities, please refer to their own page in this Library.\n\nAlthough Jedi and Sith only use one weapon, they have access to a wide\n range of Force powers and abilities that turn them into deadly foes:\n\nWEAPON:\nLightsaber\n\nABILITIES:\nSaber Offense\nSaber Defense\nSaber Deflect\n\nFORCE POWERS:\nForce Jump\nForce Push\nForce Pull\nForce Sense\nForce Speed (Jedi exclusive)\nMind Trick (Jedi exclusive)\nForce Grip (Sith exclusive)\nForce Lightning (Sith exclusive)\nForce Block\n\nCLASS SPECIALS:\nSpecial 1: Uses Saber Throw.\nSpecial 2: Performs a melee attack that shoves enemies back."

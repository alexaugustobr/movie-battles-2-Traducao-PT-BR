REFERENCE			VER_ZERO_ONE_FIVE
LANG_ENGLISH		"Changes from V1.3.1\n\n-General-\nIncreased Yellow DFA's BP drain by 50%.\nSabers: Non-crouching backslashes and speed lunges no longer stagger thus making them finishing moves rather than spammable moves. BP drain tweaked accordingly.\nUpdates for continued compatibility with jaMME.\n\n-Bug Fixes-\nImplemented workaround for bug where map scripts dependent on variables eventually stopped working on rotation servers.\nDefault com_affinity is now 1 instead of 0 (reverted change).\nDuel Mode now does not show anyone in the radar unless you are using Force Sense.\nDuel Mode Force Sense 3 now correctly highlights all other players as red (enemies).\nCannot use Force Speed, Mind Trick nor Force Heal while staggered, whether saber is turned on or off.\nTaunts no longer impede blocking saber attacks nor blaster fire in any way.\nJAMP client no longer crashes when creating local server and r_mode is set to -1 (widescreen).\n\n-Models-\nAdded pumpkin hats under new seasonal hats system. Festive hats will automatically become available for display on models during certain times of the year (toggle visibility in visual options).\nAdded Kylo Ren lightsaber hilt with custom visual effects (no gameplay impact).\n\n-UI-\nAdded option to toggle seasonal hats under the Visuals menu (cg_scrooge in console).\nSMOD removeban command permission is no longer tied to SMOD ban. Add 4096 to SMOD permissions to allow use of removeban.\nNew chat and voice chat icons.\n\n-Maps-\n-mb2_echobase\nAdded new crate model from unreleased Hoth map.\nImproved clipping for models in cargo room.\n-mb2_kamino\nFixed minimap coordinates.\n-lotr_helmsdeep\nFixed gap in castle floor."
